                        <p><em>Welcome to the Oxford Academy website!</em></p>
                        <p>We hope to present here glimpses of what we stand for — a home for children from across the
                            country and beyond. While academics is the numero uno focus area for us, the other aspects
                            of education hold no less importance. This stems from the belief that just a 90 plus
                            aggregate on the report card isn’t going to guarantee success for our children when they
                            grow up into young men and pass out from the portals of this institution. How they conduct
                            themselves, articulate their vision, handle adverse circumstances, the humility with which
                            they lead and, probably more than anything else, how they think, will be of at least as much
                            importance as their academic result as they face the challenges outside.

                        </p>
                        <p>We’ve come to realise that parents at home and parents here at school must forge a
                            partnership in the education of the children under our care. Together we must create a
                            generation of world citizens who will be well prepared to handle the ever-increasing
                            challenges of sustaining what we call our world; together we must bring up our children so
                            that they are ready to take charge of this Earth when it's time for our generation to walk
                            away into the sunset, secure in the knowledge that this beautiful blue planet of ours is in
                            the ablest and the securest of hands, hands that we together have helped create.</p>
                            <p>I look forward to meeting you and discussing all that I’ve shared above.</p>
